# PGA-Tour-Analysis-2010-2018-
Hello. I am a beginner golfer and a data science undergraduate.

## Motivation
Im trying to improve my understanding of the game with numbers. To improve crazy fast and ultimately win more games. 

## This is me exploring golf with data science. Tying in my expertise with my foreseeable life-long obsession with golf.
This project is inspired by Columbia Business School's Professor Mark Broadie's "Every Shot Counts", and the godfather of Golf Analytics.
<ul>I am trying to replicate the visualizations in his book</ul>
<ul>critically analyse the data and figure out how and why he made the decisions he did for the analysis, at every step of the way</ul>
<ul>experiement with Machine Learning techniques to improve upon his models (hopefully haha)</ul>
