# PGA-Tour-Analysis-2010-2018-

## I am a beginner golfer and an data science undergraduate.
Im trying to improve my understanding of the game with numbers. To improve crazy fast and ultimately win more games.

## This is me exploring golf with data science. Tying in my expertise with my current obsession with golf.
This project is inspired by Mark Broadie's "Every Shot Counts".
<ul>I am trying to replicate the visualizations in his book</ul>
<ul>critically analyse the data and figure out the decisions he took in the analysis, at every step of the way</ul>
<ul>experiement with Machine Learning techniques to improve upon his models (hopefully haha)</ul>
