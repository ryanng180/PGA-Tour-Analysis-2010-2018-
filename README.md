# PGA-Tour-Analysis-2010-2018-
Hello, I am a beginner golfer. And I study data science and applied math.

I started this mini project in Apr 2024 with the aim to improve my understanding of the game with numbers. Tying in my expertise with my foreseeable life-long obsession with golf seems like the easiest investment to make.
With the gradual phasing out of public golf courses in Singapore, the game of golf is becoming increasingly exlusive. Thankfully, the rise in popularity of indoor golf simulators, a much more flexible alternative to the regular 9 or 18 hole games, gives me another avenue to enjoy the game I love. 

To improve crazy fast and ultimately win more games is the goal. Harnessing data from the simulators is but only one aspect of improvement. Often golf strategy and the mental aspects to the game seem way more elusive and difficult to hone. A big component of my project is for me to understand, uncover and utilize PGA Tour data to optimize my practise sessions at the range/simulators and learn to make better decisions on the green.


## This is me exploring golf with data science.

This project is inspired by Mark Broadie's "Every Shot Counts", the godfather of Golf Analytics.
<ul>I am trying to replicate the visualizations in his book</ul>
<ul>critically analyse the data and figure out how and why he made the decisions he did for the analysis, at every step of the way</ul>
<ul>experiement with Machine Learning techniques to improve upon his models (hopefully haha)</ul>
